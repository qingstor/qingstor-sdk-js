# List Multipart Uploads

Get a list of ongoing multipart upload objects. When an object has the segment upload mode enabled via the Initiate Multipart interface, the object is in the "multiply uploading" state before the Complete Multipart or Abort Multipart interface is called. This object will appear in the list returned by the interface.

## Prepare

You need to initialize the Bucket object before. Please refer to [here](./initialize_config_and_qingstor.md) about how to initialing a Bucket.

## Code Snippet

Bucket has a method called `listMultipartUploads` for getting multipart uploads:

```javascript
/**
 * List multipart uploads in the bucket
 * @param {Object} options - User input options;
 *
 * @return {Promise} axios response
 */
bucket.listMultipartUploads(options).then((response) => {
  console.log(response.data);
}).catch((error) => {
  console.log(error);
});
```
